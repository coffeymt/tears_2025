# SBCCTears Frontend (scaffold)

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold created inside the monorepo at `web/`.

Quick start (requires `pnpm`):

```powershell
cd web
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Notes:
- Tailwind CSS, ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest are configured as devDependencies in `package.json`.
- Rename `.env.sample` to `.env` (or set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) before running.
- This scaffold does not yet install npm packages â€” run `pnpm install` to fetch them.
