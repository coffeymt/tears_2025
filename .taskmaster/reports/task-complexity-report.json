		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Scaffolding and Database Schema Setup",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into four subtasks: 1. Initialize the FastAPI project with a standard directory structure. 2. Implement database connection logic and environment variable handling. 3. Define all specified SQLAlchemy ORM models. 4. Set up Alembic and create the initial database migration script.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity comes from integrating multiple foundational technologies (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, Supabase). While each step is standard, ensuring they work together correctly requires careful setup. Breaking it down ensures each component is configured properly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into three logical subtasks covering registration, login/JWT, and the protected endpoint. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "Authentication is a critical and moderately complex feature involving cryptography, token management, and security patterns. The existing three subtasks provide a perfect, logical breakdown of the required work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Password Reset Flow with Email Integration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into three logical subtasks covering the token model, the request endpoint, and the submit endpoint. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity is high due to the interaction between multiple systems (API, database, external email service) and the critical security nature of the workflow. The existing breakdown is excellent and covers all major components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Seed Canonical NFL Teams Data",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is simple and well-defined. The existing single subtask is sufficient. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward data-loading task with very low complexity. The primary requirement is writing an idempotent script, which is a minor challenge. The task is too small to warrant further breakdown."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Weeks Management API",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks: 1. Implement a reusable admin authorization dependency. 2. Develop the standard CRUD endpoints for the 'weeks' resource. 3. Implement the specific business logic for the 'set-current-week' endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "The task combines standard CRUD with an authorization layer and a specific business rule (only one current week). Separating the concerns of authorization, basic data management, and the special business logic endpoint makes implementation clearer."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Internal ESPN Game Sync Job",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into four subtasks: 1. Create the secure internal endpoint. 2. Implement the ESPN API client to fetch game data. 3. Develop the service to transform and normalize the API response. 4. Implement the transactional database logic to sync the games.",
			"reasoning": "Complexity is high due to the external API dependency, data transformation logic, and the need for a robust database update strategy. Breaking it down isolates the API client, data mapping, and DB persistence logic, which is a good pattern for ETL-style tasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Player Entries Management API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into three logical subtasks covering create/list, update/delete with locking, and uniqueness validation. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard CRUD but is complicated by ownership checks and time-based business rules. The existing subtasks correctly separate the basic operations from the more complex validation and locking logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Weekly Pick Submission API",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into four granular subtasks, each addressing a specific validation rule. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "This is one of the most complex business logic tasks, involving multiple, layered validation rules that query different parts of the database. The existing granular breakdown is ideal for tackling this complexity systematically."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Game Finalization and Pick Resolution Logic",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into four sequential subtasks that mirror the required workflow. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex batch processing task that affects multiple entities and determines game outcomes. The sequential, dependent nature of the steps adds to the complexity. The existing breakdown mirrors this workflow perfectly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Public Pre-Reveal and Site Time Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks, one for each required public endpoint: `/api/weeks/current`, `/api/teams`, and `/api/site-time`.",
			"reasoning": "The task is simple, involving basic read-only data fetching with no authentication or complex logic. Breaking it down by endpoint is a straightforward way to organize the work for parallel development if needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Post-Reveal Data Endpoints",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks: 1. Implement the endpoint structure with the time-based lock validation. 2. Develop the database aggregation query for the pick distribution. 3. Implement the logic to assemble and return the final snapshot payload.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the combination of a time-based access control rule and a database aggregation query. Separating the access logic from the data query and final data assembly is a clean way to structure the implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Create Player Dashboard Aggregation API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into four logical subtasks that cover schema definition, data fetching, and final assembly. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "Aggregation endpoints can be complex to implement efficiently. The task involves fetching and merging data from multiple sources. The existing breakdown follows a logical implementation path: define the contract, build the pieces, then assemble them."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Build Admin User and Entry Management APIs",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks: 1. Develop the user management endpoints. 2. Develop the entry listing and filtering endpoint. 3. Develop the specific endpoints for manually overriding entry payment and elimination status.",
			"reasoning": "The task covers management of two different resources (users, entries) with distinct functionalities. Grouping the work by resource and function provides a clear separation of concerns for the implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Broadcast Email System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand this task into three subtasks: 1. Create the secure admin broadcast endpoint. 2. Implement the service logic to build the recipient list based on the specified filter. 3. Implement the email sending logic that iterates through the list and integrates with the email service.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity comes from combining authorization, dynamic database querying, and iterating over an external service call (email). Breaking it down separates the API layer, the recipient-finding logic, and the actual email sending process."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Season History Matrix API",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into four subtasks that correctly prioritize schema definition, initial implementation, performance optimization, and final assembly. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "The primary challenge of this task is database performance at scale. A naive implementation could be very slow. The existing subtasks wisely separate the initial functional implementation from the critical performance tuning step."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Create Legacy Data Import Tooling from GCS",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This task is already well-expanded into five sequential subtasks that correctly handle the dependencies between data models. No further expansion is needed.",
			"reasoning": "Data migration is notoriously complex. This task involves an external dependency (GCS), strict ordering requirements to maintain referential integrity, data transformation, and idempotency. The existing breakdown correctly tackles the problem in layers of increasing dependency."
