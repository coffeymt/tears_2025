		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Scaffold React Frontend with Vite and TypeScript",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of scaffolding the React frontend into subtasks for each major tool: Vite initialization, Tailwind CSS configuration, ESLint setup, and Prettier integration.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity as it involves standard boilerplate and configuration of well-known tools. The steps are discrete and can be broken down easily for clear progress tracking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Layout, Routing, and Protected Routes",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task of implementing core layout and routing into subtasks for: setting up React Router, creating the main `Layout` component with `TopNav` and `Footer`, building the `ProtectedRoute` component, and building the `AdminRoute` component.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to the combination of UI layout, routing setup, and authentication/authorization logic. The protected route components introduce state management dependencies and conditional rendering logic."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Centralized API Client with Axios and Auth Interceptors",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of the centralized API client into subtasks for: creating the base Axios instance with environment variable configuration, implementing the request interceptor to attach JWTs, and implementing the response interceptor for global error handling (e.g., 401 Unauthorized).",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity because it's a critical, non-UI infrastructure task. Correctly implementing interceptors for auth token attachment and global error handling (especially 401s for logout/refresh) is crucial and error-prone."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Authentication Context and Hooks",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the implementation of the authentication context into subtasks for: defining the context type and provider structure, creating the `login` and `register` functions with API integration, implementing the `logout` function and state cleanup, and adding logic to fetch the current user on initial application load.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. This is a foundational piece of the application's state management. It requires careful design of the context's state shape and API, handling async operations, and managing loading/error states that will affect the entire UI."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Build Authentication Pages and Forms",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of building authentication pages into subtasks for each page: Login, Registration, Forgot Password, and Reset Password. Each subtask should include creating the UI, setting up the form with React Hook Form and Zod, and integrating with the `useAuth` context.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to the volume of work (four separate forms/pages) and the integration of multiple technologies: UI components, routing, form management (`react-hook-form`), schema validation (`zod`), and state management (`useAuth`)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement `useSiteTime` Hook for Server-Synced Time",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the `useSiteTime` hook implementation into subtasks for: fetching the initial server time and calculating the client-server offset, setting up an interval to provide a continuously updating time value based on the offset, and handling cleanup of the interval.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity for a custom hook. The logic involves managing side effects (`setInterval`), performing an initial async fetch, and correctly calculating and applying a time offset, which is more complex than a simple data-fetching hook."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop the Main Dashboard Page",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the development of the main dashboard into subtasks for: creating the overall page layout, building the `WeekCard` component including the countdown powered by `useSiteTime`, building the `EntryCard` component to display entry summaries, and integrating the necessary React Query hooks to fetch week and entry data.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity as it's a composite view that integrates multiple data sources (weeks, entries) and custom logic (the `useSiteTime` countdown). It requires careful data fetching strategy and component composition."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build User Account Management Page",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the user account management page into subtasks for: fetching and displaying current user data, building the profile update form, building the password change form, and implementing the UI for notification preferences.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. It involves fetching initial data to populate forms, implementing two separate forms with validation (`react-hook-form`, `zod`), and handling API mutations for updates. It's a standard but non-trivial feature."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Entries Management Page",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the entries management page into subtasks for: fetching and displaying the list of user entries, implementing the 'Create New Entry' modal and form, adding functionality to rename an entry, and adding functionality to delete an entry with a confirmation dialog.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to it being a full CRUD interface. It requires managing a list view, modal states for creation/editing, handling multiple mutations (create, update, delete), and ensuring the UI updates correctly using React Query's cache invalidation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Weekly Pick Submission UI",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the pick submission UI task into subtasks for: fetching all teams and the entry's pick history, building the main `TeamGrid` component, implementing the logic to disable already-picked teams, creating the confirmation modal, and setting up the React Query mutation for submitting/editing the pick with optimistic updates.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the intricate UI logic. It requires merging data from multiple endpoints to determine the state of each grid item, managing selection state, and implementing a sophisticated mutation with optimistic updates for a good user experience."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Reveal Snapshot Page",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the reveal page implementation into subtasks for: creating the components for the `GamesList`, `DistributionChart`, and `Leaderboard`, fetching the aggregated reveal data, and implementing the logic to restrict page access until after the weekly lock time.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. It requires fetching and rendering three distinct and potentially large datasets (games, distribution, leaderboard). Integrating a charting library and ensuring the page is only accessible after the lock time adds to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Scaffold Admin Console with Protected Routes",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the admin console scaffolding task into subtasks for: creating a new `AdminLayout` component with a sidebar, defining the nested routes for all admin pages (`/weeks`, `/users`, etc.), and applying the `AdminRoute` wrapper to protect the entire `/admin` section.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity as it primarily involves creating a new layout component and configuring routes. The critical security logic is reused from the `AdminRoute` component, making this task mostly structural."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Build Admin UI for Weeks and Games Management",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the admin weeks/games UI into subtasks for: building the main page to list all weeks with CRUD actions, creating the form/modal for creating and editing a week, building the nested page for managing games within a specific week, creating the editable table for game CRUD, and implementing the ESPN sync functionality.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity. This involves building two separate, full CRUD interfaces for related data models. The UI requires tables, modals, complex forms with date pickers, and a special action to trigger a backend process, making it a substantial piece of work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Develop History Matrix, Leaderboard, and Usage Page",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the history page task into subtasks for: creating the tabbed layout, implementing the main matrix view using a virtualization library, building the season leaderboard tab, and building the team usage statistics tab. Each tab should handle its own data fetching.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity, primarily due to the requirement of implementing a virtualized matrix for performance. Virtualization libraries add a significant implementation and debugging overhead. The other two tabs are simpler but still contribute to the overall workload."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Build Admin UI for User Management",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the admin user management UI into subtasks for: building the main data table to display a paginated list of users, implementing the search and filter inputs that trigger new API calls, adding the functionality to toggle a user's admin role, and adding the functionality to trigger a password reset for a user.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Implementing a data table with server-side pagination and filtering is a non-trivial task that requires managing query parameters and state carefully. Adding per-row mutations adds to the interactive complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Build Admin UI for Broadcast Messages",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the admin broadcast UI into subtasks for: building the main form with subject and recipient filter controls, integrating a rich text editor for the message body, implementing the 'Preview' functionality to render a sample email, and implementing the 'Send' functionality with a confirmation modal.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. Integrating a rich text editor adds a layer of complexity. The workflow involving recipient filtering, previewing the message, and a final confirmation step makes it a multi-stage process to implement."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Develop UI for GCS Data Migration",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the data migration UI into subtasks for: creating the main component with controls for 'Dry Run' and 'Final Import', implementing the logic to call the migration API and handle loading/error states, and designing and building the component to clearly display the validation report from the API response.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. While the UI controls are simple, the core of the task is to fetch, parse, and render a potentially complex validation report from the backend. The high-stakes nature of the operation requires a very clear and robust UI for displaying results."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Unit & Integration Testing with Vitest",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the Vitest setup task into subtasks for: installing and configuring Vitest, `jsdom`, and React Testing Library; writing initial unit tests for pure utility functions; and writing the first integration tests for a key hook (`useSiteTime`) and a simple component.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity. Setting up the testing environment from scratch, including configuration and establishing testing patterns for the project, requires specific expertise beyond typical feature development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up E2E Testing with Playwright",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Playwright setup into subtasks for: installing and configuring Playwright for the project; writing the first test suite for the authentication flow (registration and login); and writing a test suite for the core user journey of submitting a weekly pick.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. E2E test setup and writing the first few stable tests for critical user flows is challenging. It requires a different skillset than component development, involving browser automation, selectors, and managing test data."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Configure CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the CI/CD pipeline configuration into subtasks for: creating the initial workflow file triggered on pull requests; adding a job for static analysis (linting, type-checking); adding a separate job for running unit tests; and adding a final job to create a production build.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Requires specific knowledge of GitHub Actions syntax and concepts. Properly configuring jobs, steps, caching dependencies, and integrating with PR status checks is a specialized DevOps task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Cloudflare for Staging and Production Deployments",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Cloudflare configuration into subtasks for: creating the Cloudflare Pages project and linking it to the GitHub repository; configuring distinct deployment settings and environment variables for production and staging branches; and updating the GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to Cloudflare.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. This is a crucial DevOps task that involves configuring cloud infrastructure. It requires understanding deployment environments, build settings, environment variable management, and integrating the CI/CD pipeline with the cloud provider."
		},
		{

			"taskTitle": "Execute GCS to Supabase Data Migration",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the data migration execution plan into sequential subtasks: schedule the migration window and communicate downtime, perform a final database backup, execute the migration script in dry-run mode and validate the report, execute the final migration script, and perform all post-migration verification checks.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the high risk and operational nature of the task. The score reflects the criticality of the procedure, the need for meticulous execution of a pre-defined plan, and the potential impact of failure, not the coding effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Accessibility (A11y) Polish and Validation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the accessibility polish into subtasks for: conducting an automated audit using tools like axe-core, performing a complete manual keyboard navigation audit of all user flows, remediating all identified issues related to semantic HTML and ARIA attributes, and fixing focus management and color contrast problems.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity because it's a cross-cutting concern that touches almost every component. It requires specialized knowledge (WCAG, ARIA), manual testing, and can involve significant refactoring of existing components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
